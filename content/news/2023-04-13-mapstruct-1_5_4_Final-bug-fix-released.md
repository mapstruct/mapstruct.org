It is my pleasure to announce the 1.5.4.Final bug fix release of MapStruct.
This release includes support for Jakarta CDI , 5 bug fixes and a documentation improvement.

<!--more-->

### Jakarta CDI

In the 1.5 releases we added support for the Jakarta namespace.
With this release we are enhancing the support by supporting Jakarta CDI.
This should make it easier for people that want to use MapStruct with Jakarta EE 10.
