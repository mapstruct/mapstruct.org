MapStruct 1.1.0.CR1 consolodates the functionality introduced in the preceeding MapStruct 1.1.0 Beta releases. A number of bugs is solved:

* Automatic generation of an iterable mapping methods where the property selection is based on a qualfier.
* Collection source getter null check to avoid NullPointExceptions.
* Missing imports for generic types in collections in generated methods.
* Removing redundant code from generated code when using nested source properties.
* Optimalisation when using enum constant (using an enum constant instead of a string conversion).
* Fixing order for dependsOn.
* Fixing an issue in a Beta2 introduced commit that causes problems for the @MappingTarget in combination with @InheritInverseConfiguration

The list of closed issues can be found in the [change log](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.0.CR1).

Also, the documentation is improved on our AccessorNamingStrategy Service Provider Interface. An example has been added [Examples repository](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct-examples) to support the documentation.

Thanks to: [Markus Heberling](https://github.com/tisoft), and [Filip Hrisafov](https://github.com/filiphr) for their contribution!
