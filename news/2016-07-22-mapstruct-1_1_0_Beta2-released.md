It has been a while since the latest release of MapStruct. Via our mailing list, issue list and other channels we have received valuable feedback. We have tried to incorporate some of that feedback into a number of new features.

MapStruct 1.1.0.Beta2 introduces a number of popular requested features, like source presence check and nested target properties.

Today we release MapStruct 1.1.0.Beta2, containing fixes for most of the user-reported bugs:

* OSGI-enabled jars.
* Extended support of `java.text.NumberFormat` for Number types to String mapping.
* Support of presence checkers on the source side of bean mappings, For instance calling the default presence checker `hasXYZ` prior mapping. The presence checker can be overidden.
* Mapping nested target properties.
* Solving an Eclipse Neon MapStruct compilation issue.

The complete list of 12 closed issues can be found in the [change log](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.0.Beta2).

The MapStruct teams thanks: [Sean Huang](https://github.com/seanjob), and [Ciaran Liedeman](https://github.com/cliedeman) for their contribution! 

### What's next?

We hope to release 1.1.0.CR1 in a short while (after the summer holidays).

Please also checkout our examples [GitHub examples repository](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct-examples). It is still small but the intention is to make this a repository of typical mapping problems and how to solve them with MapStruct. Contributing good examples is appriciated.
